<h1>Fucking Texts</h1>

<main>
    <p>Hi, welcome to Fucking Texts. This little utility will give you some text stats. It's all done client side so no need to worry about me storing any information (like I want to read your bullshit anyway). Also, it's just for iPhones right now because that's what I have. I'll look up Android later so you fucks will just have to wait.</p>
    <p>The iPhone text DB is a file named '3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28' and it's located in your itunes backup directory.<br /><br/>
    Windows: \Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\(most recent backup)\3d\<br/>
    Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/(most recent backup)/3d/<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <label class="button">Load an iPhone text backup file: <input type='file' id='dbfile' ></label><br/>
    <select title="years" id="years"></select>
    <pre id="output"></pre>
    <label id="error" class="error"></label>
